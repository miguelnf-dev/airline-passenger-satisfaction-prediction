# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Introduction
This repository hosts a Machine Learning project focusing on the prediction of airline passengers' satisfaction levels.  This project leverages binary classification techniques in a structured and systematic approach.
The entire repo is in English, but the code, as well as the accompanying reports are in Portuguese (PT).

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

git clone https://github.com/miguelnf-dev/airline-passenger-satisfaction-prediction.git

cd airline-passenger-satisfaction-prediction

2. **Set Up Conda Environment**:

conda create -n myenv python=3.8

conda activate myenv

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
  
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Running the Notebooks**:
- Launch Jupyter:

- Open and run `eda.ipynb`, `additional_exploration.ipynb`, and `model.ipynb` as desired.

*Replace `myenv` with your environment name. Ensure Python version compatibility.*

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Involves data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing. 
2. **Model Creation** - Focuses on training and testing machine learning models to predict satisfaction levels.

## Dataset
The dataset, named "Airline Passenger Satisfaction," is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction). It includes various attributes such as age, flight distance, and satisfaction levels of airline passengers.

## Notebooks
- `eda.ipynb`: Contains all EDA processes, including data visualization and preprocessing.
- `additional_exploration.ipynb`: Contains extra analysis.
- `model.ipynb`: Hosts multiple models training and evaluation code.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Dython
