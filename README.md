# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Introduction
This repository hosts a Machine Learning project focusing on the prediction of airline passengers' satisfaction levels.  This project leverages binary classification techniques in a structured and systematic approach.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main sections:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Involves data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, and preprocessing. 
2. **Model Creation** - Focuses on training and testing machine learning models to predict satisfaction levels.

## Dataset
The dataset, named "Airline Passenger Satisfaction," is sourced from Kaggle. It includes various attributes such as age, flight distance, and satisfaction levels of airline passengers.

## Notebooks
- `EDA.ipynb`: Contains all EDA processes, including data visualization and preprocessing.
- `Model_Creation.ipynb`: Hosts the model training and evaluation code.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Dython

## Installation
